# Adobe Lightroom Plugin - Multi-Stage Pipeline Update

## Overview

The Adobe Lightroom plugin has been updated to support the new **Multi-Stage Processing Pipeline**, bringing professional-grade image curation and analysis directly into your Lightroom workflow.

## 🚀 New Features

### Multi-Stage Analysis Menu Item

A new menu option "🚀 Multi-Stage Analysis (IQA + AI)" provides access to the advanced pipeline:

**What it does:**
1. **Image Quality Assessment (IQA)** - Evaluates all images using BRISQUE/NIQE/MUSIQ/TOPIQ algorithms
2. **Smart Curation** - Selects only top-quality images (5-50% threshold) 
3. **AI Analysis** - Applies expensive AI models only to curated images
4. **Professional Metadata** - Saves results as XMP sidecars or embedded EXIF

**Benefits:**
- ⚡ 85% faster processing 
- 💰 90% cost reduction for cloud APIs
- 🎯 Focus AI analysis on highest quality images
- 📊 Professional image quality assessment

### Enhanced Settings Panel

The Plugin Settings now include dedicated multi-stage pipeline options:

#### IQA Model Selection
- **BRISQUE** (Recommended) - Fast, conventional spatial domain analysis
- **NIQE** - Natural image quality evaluator  
- **MUSIQ** - Deep learning transformer model
- **TOPIQ** - Advanced CNN with semantic features

#### Quality Threshold Options
- **Top 5%** (Ultra-selective) - Only exceptional images
- **Top 10%** (Recommended) - High-quality subset
- **Top 15-25%** (Balanced) - Moderate filtering
- **Top 50%** (Liberal) - Remove worst images only

#### Metadata Storage
- **XMP Sidecar Files** (Default) - Non-destructive, Lightroom compatible
- **Embedded EXIF** (Optional) - Direct file modification

## 🎯 Use Cases

```

## 📋 How to Use

### 1. Access Multi-Stage Analysis

In Lightroom:
- Go to **Library** → **Plugin Settings** → **AI Image Analyzer**
- Configure your multi-stage pipeline preferences
- Use **Library** → **🚀 Multi-Stage Analysis (IQA + AI)** menu

### 2. Configure Pipeline Settings

**Required Settings:**

### 3. Run Multi-Stage Analysis

1. Select folder containing images to analyze
2. Pipeline automatically:
   - Discovers all supported image files
   - Scores every image for quality using IQA model
   - Selects top percentage based on threshold
   - Analyzes selected images with AI model
   - Generates metadata (categories, tags, ratings, critiques)
   - Saves as XMP sidecar files or embedded EXIF

### 4. Import Results into Lightroom

1. Import the processed folder into Lightroom
2. XMP metadata automatically appears in Lightroom
3. Use generated star ratings and keywords for organization
4. "GALLERY" tag automatically added to 5-star images

### Performance Optimization

**Traditional Approach:**
- 1000 images × 30s/image = 8.3 hours + $50 API costs

**Multi-Stage Approach:**
- 1000 images × 0.1s IQA + 100 images × 30s AI = 1 hour + $5 API costs
- **Savings: 85% time, 90% cost**

### Metadata Schema

**XMP Sidecar Contents:**
```xml
<rdf:Description>
    <xmp:Rating>5</xmp:Rating>
    <dc:subject>Beautiful, Landscape, Natural Light</dc:subject>
    <dc:description>Category: Place, Subcategory: Landscape</dc:description>
    <dc:title>Score: 9/10</dc:title>
    <dc:rights>Critique: Professional analysis...</dc:rights>
</rdf:Description>
```

## 🔧 Setup Requirements

### Flask Web Service
The plugin requires the AI Image Analyzer Flask service running:

```bash
cd ai-image-analyzer
python web/app.py
```

Service runs on `http://localhost:5001` by default.

### Dependencies
Ensure the Flask service has multi-stage pipeline dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision pyiqa PyExifTool
```

### ExifTool Installation
For XMP sidecar support, install ExifTool:
- **Windows**: Download from https://exiftool.org/
- **macOS**: `brew install exiftool`
- **Linux**: `sudo apt-get install exiftool`

### BRISQUE (Recommended)
- **Type**: Conventional spatial domain analysis
- **Speed**: Very fast
- **Best for**: General synthetic distortions (blur, noise, compression)
- **Score**: Lower is better (0-100 scale)

### NIQE 
- **Type**: Natural image quality evaluator
- **Speed**: Fast
- **Best for**: Similar to BRISQUE, effective for common distortions
- **Score**: Lower is better

### MUSIQ

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Service Not Available"**
- Ensure Flask service is running: `python web/app.py`
- Check service URL in Plugin Settings (default: `http://localhost:5001`)
- Verify firewall settings allow local connections

**"No images selected for processing"**  
- Lower quality threshold (try 20-50%)
- Check image directory contains supported formats (.jpg, .png, .tif)
- Verify images are readable and not corrupted

**"IQA model failed to load"**
- Ensure PyTorch dependencies are installed: `pip install torch torchvision pyiqa`
- Check for GPU compatibility issues
- Try CPU-only mode in pipeline configuration

**XMP sidecars not created**
- Verify ExifTool is installed and in PATH
- Check write permissions in target directory
- Ensure PyExifTool package is installed: `pip install PyExifTool`

**Gemini API errors**
- Verify API key is correct and active
- Check API quota and billing status
- Ensure stable internet connection for cloud API

### Performance Tips

**For Large Collections (10,000+ images):**
- Use BRISQUE IQA model (fastest)
- Set conservative quality threshold (5-10%)
- Process in smaller batches if needed
- Use local models (Ollama/BakLLaVA) to avoid API limits

**For Best Quality Results:**
- Use MUSIQ or TOPIQ IQA models (if GPU available)
- Combine with Professional Art Critic perspective
- Enable curatorial descriptions for 5-star images
- Use XMP sidecars for maximum Lightroom compatibility
