# Project Cleanup & Refactoring Summary

This document outlines the files and directories that were removed from the project to streamline the codebase and focus on the new desktop-centric architecture.

## Rationale

The primary goal of this cleanup was to eliminate the old, complex, and high-maintenance components of the project, specifically the web-based UI and the old Lightroom plugin. This allows for a more focused development effort on the new, more reliable, and more powerful desktop application and its streamlined Lightroom integration.

By removing these components, we have:

-   **Reduced Codebase Complexity**: A simpler, more maintainable project.
-   **Eliminated Redundancy**: No more duplicate logic between a web app, a desktop app, and a plugin.
-   **Improved User Experience**: A more familiar and reliable workflow for photographers.
-   **Simplified Installation**: A single desktop application to install, with a simple plugin for Lightroom.

## Removed Files & Directories

The following is a list of the major components that have been removed from the project:

### 1. Old Lightroom Plugin

-   **Directory**: `ai-image-analyzer.lrplugin/`
-   **Reason for Removal**: This was the old, complex plugin that relied on a web server and had a complicated UI. It has been completely replaced by the new, streamlined `ai-image-analyzer-v2.lrplugin/` which uses a simple "send-to-app" workflow.

### 2. Web Interface

-   **Directory**: `web/`
-   **Reason for Removal**: The Flask-based web UI is no longer needed. The standalone desktop application (`ai_image_analyzer_gui_v2.py`) provides a superior, local-first experience.

### 3. Obsolete Scripts

-   Numerous individual scripts in the `scripts/` directory that were related to the old web interface or were experimental have been removed.

### 4. Outdated Documentation

-   All `*.md` files related to the old architecture, web interface, and previous versions of the plugin have been removed to avoid confusion.

### 5. Obsolete Configuration Files

-   Old configuration files and directories (`config/`, `configs/`, `docker-compose.yml`, etc.) related to the web server and old plugin have been removed.

## New Project Structure

The project now has a much cleaner and more focused structure:

-   `main.py`: The single entry point for the desktop application.
-   `ai_image_analyzer_gui_v2.py`: The core code for the desktop GUI.
-   `pipeline_core.py`: The backend processing pipeline.
-   `ai-image-analyzer-v2.lrplugin/`: The new, streamlined Lightroom plugin.
-   `exiftoolapp/`: The exiftool binary for metadata operations.
-   `README.md`: Updated documentation for the new architecture.

This cleanup effort results in a more professional, maintainable, and user-friendly project that is easier to use, develop, and contribute to.
